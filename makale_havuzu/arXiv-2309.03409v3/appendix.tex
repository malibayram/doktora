\section{Some Failure Cases}
\label{appsec:some_failure_cases}
Although LLMs show the power of optimizing basic math problems (Section~\ref{sec:motivating_example}) and prompts (Section~\ref{sec:application_prompt_opt}), we see some limitations across all optimizer LLMs that may impede their power of solving more challenging problems.
These limitations include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em,topsep=0pt,partopsep=1ex,parsep=0ex]
\item \textbf{Hallucinating the values that need to come from math calculation}: The optimizer LLMs often output contents like ``the function value at (5, 3) is 15'' despite that the true value is not 15. 
The model will get it right if external tools that can reliably calculate the value are triggered.
When and how to trigger such tool use cases remains an interesting topic (see e.g., \citep{schick2023toolformer,cai2023large}).
\item \textbf{Generating solutions already appeared in context even if we tell it to "Give me a new (w, b) pair that is different from all pairs above"}: the optimizer LLMs do not 100\% reliably follow this instruction even if its own outputs often include sentences like ``I will provide a new pair that is different'', making the output self-contradictory.
The output is almost guaranteed to be different from in-context old solutions when the model output contains a comparison of the new pair and all old pairs, though.
Thus (implicitly) triggering such behaviors may be a solution.
How to implement this feature without harming the instruction following performance of other parts remains an interesting topic to study.
\item \textbf{In black-box math optimization, getting stuck at a point that is neither global nor local optimal}: This often occurs in two linear regression cases: (a) The in-context exemplars all share the same $w$ or $b$ that is different from $w_\text{true}$ or $b_\text{true}$.
This case is more likely to be avoided when a larger number of past solutions are included in the meta-prompt; (b) one or several of the best previous solutions in the meta-prompt have $w$s and $b$s in quantitatively opposite directions from the global optima $w_\text{true}$ and $b_\text{true}$: for example, the $w$s are all smaller than $w_\text{true}$ while the $b$s are all larger than $b_\text{true}$.
Since the optimizer model often proposes to only increase $w$ or decrease $b$ when the past solutions in meta-prompt share $w$ or $b$, the optimization will get stuck if either increasing $w$ or decreasing $b$ would increase the objective value.
This issue is mitigated by sampling multiple new solutions (thus more exploration) at each step.
\item \textbf{Hard to navigate a bumpy loss landscape}: Like other optimizers, it is harder for the optimizer LLM to optimize black-box functions when the loss landscape gets more complicated.
For example, when minimizing the Rosenbrock function $f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b (y - x^2)^2$ with $a=20$ (whose global optimal point is $x=20$, $y=400$) with 5 starting points in $[10, 20] \times [10, 20]$, the optimization often gets stuck at around $(0, 0)$.
This is because the optimizer LLM sees a decrease of objective value when it drastically decreases both $x$ and $y$ to $0$.
Then starting from $(0, 0)$, the optimizer LLM is hard to further navigate $x$ and $y$ along the narrow valley in the loss landscape towards $(20, 400)$ (Figure~\ref{fig:rosenbrock_visualization}).

\caption{A visualization of the landscape of the Rosenbrock function $f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b (y - x^2)^2$ with $a=20$ and $b=1$.
The global optima is at $x=20$, $y=400$ with function value $0$.
The function value at $x=0$, $y=0$ is $400$.
The landscape has a narrow valley between $(0, 0)$ and $(20, 400)$.

\section{Prompting Formats for Scorer LLM}

The ``QA'' pattern is eliminated when prompting instruction-tuned scorer models like \texttt{text-bison} with the Q\_begin and Q\_end formats (Figure~\ref{fig:scorer_prompting_format_Q_begin_no_QA} and~\ref{fig:scorer_prompting_format_Q_end_no_QA}).

Task & Our Instruction \\
\midrule
boolean\_expressions & A Boolean expression is a well-formed expression consisting of variables, values, and logical operators. The expression must evaluate to a single True or False value. The order of precedence of the logical operators is as follows: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, IMP. Parentheses can be used to group subexpressions and to control the order of evaluation.\\ [2ex]
causal\_judgement & When considering questions about causation, a typical person would consider the following factors: whether the action or event was a necessary condition for the outcome to occur, a sufficient condition, a proximate cause, or a foreseeable cause. \\ [2ex]
date\_understanding & To find the date X time ago from today, first find today's date. Then subtract X time from today's date. If the current date is the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the last day of the previous month. If the current date is not the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the same day of the previous month. For example, if today is March 31, 2023, then the date a month ago is February 28, 2023. If today is April 1, 2023, then the date a month ago is March 1, 2023.\\ [2ex]
disambiguation\_qa & Identifying Antecedents of Pronouns: A Comprehensive Guide \\ [2ex]
dyck\_languages & First, look for the opening parentheses. Then, count the number of opening parentheses. Finally, close the parentheses in the reverse order that they were opened.\\ [2ex]
formal\_fallacies & A deductive argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. An invalid argument is one where it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\\ [2ex]
geometric\_shapes & A closed polygonal chain is a series of connected line segments. The line segments can be straight or curved. The first and last line segments are connected. The line segments do not intersect each other except at their endpoints. A closed polygon can be described by an SVG path element, which starts at a given point, goes to one or more additional points, and then ends at the starting point. The path element can consist of straight line segments, curved segments, or a mixture of both.\\ [2ex]
hyperbaton & The correct adjective order in English is opinion, size, shape, age, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one adjective of the same type, they are usually placed in order of importance. For example, you would say "a large, old, Pakistani ship" rather than "an old, large, Pakistani ship." There are a few exceptions to these rules, but they are generally followed in most cases.\\ [2ex]
logical\_deduction \_seven\_objects & The following questions will test your ability to use deductive reasoning. You will be given a set of statements about a group of objects. You will then be asked to answer questions about the objects based on the statements. The statements in the questions are logically consistent, so you can use them to deduce the order of the objects. For each question, you must choose the option that is logically consistent with the information in the questions.\\ [2ex]
movie\_recommendation & Based on your input, I have analyzed the given movies in terms of genre, plot, tone, audience rating, year of release, director, cast, and reviews. I have also taken into account the given options. The movie that is most similar to the given movies in terms of all these factors is:\\ [2ex]
multistep\_arithmetic \_two & The order of operations in mathematics is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. When there are multiple operations of the same precedence, they must be performed from left to right. Note that multiplication and division have the same precedence, as do addition and subtraction.\\ [2ex]
navigate & You will return to the starting point if and only if (1) the total number of steps you take forward is equal to the total number of steps you take back, and (2) the total number of turns you make is a multiple of 180 degrees.\\ [2ex]
object\_counting & Here is a list of the objects you mentioned and their corresponding counts:\\ [2ex]
penguins\_in\_a\_table & Here is my new text:\\ [2ex]
reasoning\_about \_colored\_objects & Starting from the leftmost object in the row, I observe the following objects arranged in this order:\\ [4ex]
ruin\_names & Which is the funniest pun on the artist or movie name?\\ [2ex]
salient\_translation \_error\_detection & Instructions: Read the German sentence and its English translation carefully, then identify the type of error in the translation and select the correct option. There are six possible types of errors: Named Entities, Numerical Values, Modifiers or Adjectives, Negation or Antonyms, Facts, and Dropped Content.\\ [2ex]
snarks & Identify the sarcastic statement by considering the following factors: incongruity, exaggeration, understatement, context, speaker's intent, and audience's reaction. I will also consider the speaker's tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language.\\ [2ex]
sports\_understanding & I will determine if a sentence about an athlete is plausible by first checking if it is grammatically correct. If it is, I will then check if it is consistent with the athlete's sport, position, and real-world statistics. I will also check if it is consistent with the rules of the athlete's sport. If the sentence is consistent with all of these things, I will answer "yes", otherwise I will answer "no".\\ [2ex]
temporal\_sequences & The answer is the time that is not mentioned in the given statements. \\ [2ex]
tracking\_shuffled\_objects \_seven\_objects & Claire has the blue ball, Gertrude has the black ball, and Dave has the green ball. They are all happy with their new balls. \\ [2ex]
web\_of\_lies & The answer to a question is yes if there are an odd number of liars before the current speaker, and no if there are an even number of liars before the current speaker. If the current speaker is a truth-teller, they will say the opposite of what the previous person said, while a liar will say the same thing as the previous person said. \\ [2ex]

A week ago, it was February 21, 2023, and a month ago, it was January 28, 2023. A year from now, it will be February 28, 2024. The day of the week is important to note because it will help us to correctly answer the questions below. Not all years are leap years that contain February 29. \\ [2ex]
disambiguation\_qa & A pronoun is a word that stands in for a noun. The noun that a pronoun refers to is called its antecedent. To identify the antecedent of a pronoun, look for the noun that the pronoun could be referring to. If there is only one possible noun, then that is the antecedent. If there are two or more possible nouns, then the antecedent is ambiguous. Use the context of the sentence to help you determine the correct antecedent. \\ [2ex]

geometric\_shapes & What shape is this SVG code drawing, and how many sides does it have? \\ [2ex]
hyperbaton & In English, adjectives are typically placed before nouns in a specific order. The order is: opinion, size, shape, age, color, origin, material, purpose, noun. For example, the sentence "the big, old, red barn" would be considered grammatically correct, while the sentence "the old, big, red barn" would not. Adjectives that come before nouns are called attributive adjectives, while adjectives that come after nouns are called predicative adjectives. \\ [2ex]
logical\_deduction \_seven\_objects & In this logical reasoning task, you will be given a series of paragraphs, each of which describes a set of objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements in each paragraph are logically consistent. You must read each paragraph carefully and use the information given to determine the logical relationships between the objects. You will then be asked a question about the order of the objects. Read each question carefully and choose the option that answers the question correctly. \\ [2ex]
movie\_recommendation & What is the highest-rated movie similar to the given movies, with a similar IMDb rating and released in the same year? \\ [2ex]
multistep\_arithmetic\_two & Let's solve these equations using PEMDAS order of operations. Remember that PEMDAS stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction. \\ [2ex]
navigate & Starting at the origin, facing north, follow the instructions. If your displacement from the origin is zero and your direction is unchanged, then your answer is Yes. Otherwise, your answer is No. \\ [2ex]
object\_counting & Let me help you count the items you have. Just list them one by one, separated by commas. I will then count each item and tell you how many items there are in total. \\ [2ex]
penguins\_in\_a\_table & This table shows information about penguins. The columns show the penguin’s name, age, height (in cm), and weight (in kg). The penguins are listed in order of their age, from youngest to oldest. \\ [2ex]
reasoning\_about \_colored\_objects & First, read the input carefully. Then, identify all the objects mentioned, their colors, and their positions. Next, visualize the objects and their positions in your mind. Finally, answer the questions accurately based on the information given. Make sure to pay attention to the order of the objects. \\ [2ex]
ruin\_names & A humorous edit of an artist or movie name can be created by replacing one or more letters to form a new word or phrase that sounds similar but has a different meaning. The new word or phrase should be relevant to the original word, but it should also be a surprise, which makes the edit funny. For example, the artist or movie name "Rocky" can be changed to "Ricky," and "Schindler's List" can be changed to "Schindler's Lift." Be creative and have fun! \\ [2ex]
salient\_translation \_error\_detection & The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. The error may be one of the following types: Named Entities, Numerical Values, Modifiers or Adjectives, Negation or Antonyms, Facts, or Dropped Content. Please identify the error. \\ [2ex]
snarks & The statement \\ [2ex]
sports\_understanding & To determine the plausibility of a sports sentence, I will first identify the sport, athletes, teams, and events mentioned in the sentence. Then, I will use my knowledge of the rules of the sport, the context of the sentence, common sense, and my knowledge of the world to determine whether the sentence is plausible. I will also consider the time period and location, as well as any other relevant information. Finally, I will return a score of 1 for plausible sentences and 0 for implausible ones. \\ [2ex]
temporal\_sequences & To determine the time period when a person went to a place, first identify all the time periods when the person's whereabouts are unknown. Then, rule out any time periods during which the person was seen doing something else or the place was closed. The remaining time periods are the possible times when the person could have gone to the place. \\ [2ex]
tracking\_shuffled\_objects \_seven\_objects & At the start of the game, Claire has a blue ball. Throughout the game, pairs of people swap balls. Claire ends up with the yellow ball. \\ [2ex]
web\_of\_lies & People in a group either tell the truth or lie. The truthfulness of a person's statement is determined by the statement of the previous person. If the previous person told the truth, then the current person who says the opposite is lying. If the previous person lied, then the current person who says the opposite is telling the truth. This rule applies to all subsequent statements. \\ [2ex]

\subsection{\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} as optimizer, optimization starting from the empty string}
\label{appsec:bbh_taskwise_detailed_results_gpt_3.5_turbo_optimizer_start_from_empty}

Table~\ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_s_palm_2_l_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_from_empty}, \ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_s_text_bison_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_from_empty} and~\ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_s_text_bison_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_from_empty_q_end} show the instructions found by prompt optimization.
Their accuracies are listed in Table~\ref{table:gpt_scores_on_bbh_tasks_starting_from_empty}.
Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy_comparison_bar_charts_o_gpt_3.5_turbo} visualizes the difference between their accuracies and those of the baselines ``Let's think step by step.'' and the empty string.
The optimizations find instructions better than the empty starting point, and most of the found instructions are better than ``Let's think step by step''.

One caveat in the A\_begin instructions (Table~\ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_s_palm_2_l_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_from_empty}) is that a lot of the found instructions are imperative or interrogative sentences that are more suitable to be put into ``Q:'' rather than ``A:'', like ``Solve the sequence by properly closing the parentheses.'' for dyck\_languages and ``Which movie option from the given choices ...?'' for movie\_recommendation.
Such styles appear more often here than the \texttt{PaLM 2-L-IT} optimizer results (Table~\ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_palm_2_l}), showing \texttt{PaLM 2-L-IT} understands the needed style better.
In Section~\ref{appsec:bbh_taskwise_detailed_results_gpt_3.5_turbo_optimizer_start_from_solve}, we show the A\_begin optimization results with the non-empty starting point ``Let's solve the problem.''.
Most results there are declarative sentences -- more suitable for A\_begin.

\label{appsec:bbh_taskwise_detailed_results_gpt_3.5_turbo_optimizer_start_from_solve}

Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy_comparison_bar_charts_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_start_from_solve} and Table~\ref{table:gpt_scores_on_bbh_tasks_starting_from_solve_the_problem} compare the accuracies of found instructions vs ``Let's solve the problem.'', ``Let's think step by step.'', and the instructions in Table~\ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_s_palm_2_l_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_from_empty}.
Table~\ref{table:found_instructions_on_bbh_tasks_s_palm_2_l_o_gpt_3.5_turbo_from_solve} details the found instructions.

The ``Let's'' pattern appears more often in the found instructions because of the starting points, and the instructions are more often declarative that are more suitable for A\_begin, even if some are semantically far from ``Let's solve the problem''.
In fact, ``Let's'' was adopted by~\citet{zhou2022large} as a fixed pattern in generated prompts, possibly because of the same reason.

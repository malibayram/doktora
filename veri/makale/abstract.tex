Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize the field of healthcare with their capabilities to improve access to medical information, strengthen communication with patients, and develop new treatments. However, for LLMs to be effectively and safely used in the healthcare field, it is necessary to collect and prepare high-quality data. This article discusses the process of data collection and preparation for LLM adaptation using doctor anonymous profiles and question-answer data obtained from a website where doctors answer questions asked by patients and shared publicly. Steps such as data collection, data merging, handling missing values, data type conversion, data cleaning, data quality control, preparation for LLM training, and text preprocessing are detailed. The prepared data is used for fine-tuning the LLAMA 3 model developed by Meta company and the cosmosGPT v0.1 model developed by YTU COSMOS artificial intelligence research group. As a result, the models have started to provide better answers to questions asked in Turkish in the healthcare field. This study highlights the importance of collecting and preparing quality data for the use of LLMs in healthcare.
